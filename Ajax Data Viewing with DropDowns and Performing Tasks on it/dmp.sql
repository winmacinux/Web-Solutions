Share a story about “seeing the light at the end of the tunnel” that you experienced personally.  This will help develop more rapport and enable trust from the “non-productive team member.”  Positive reinforcement includes primary reinforcers such as smiles, touch (hand shakes), verbal thanks and exchangeable reinforcement such as talk about payday, bonuses or potential promotions for achieving or exceeding goals.

Since, I had worked in the sponsorship team during my 3rd year too, I had complete info about the whole process and knew what could be the areas where we were lacking. So, first thing I did after taking the command was to first device a strategy by asking suggestions from everyone in the team. We came to the conclusion that – we were not completely tapping our local market, had a major problem in proposal, and poor promotion. Therefore, in response, we organized a complete separate event “Jalandhar got talent” for Jalandhar to attract local sponsors, stopped mentioning price brackets in the proposal, instead mentioned different prices for different companies, and at last played a gamble to sell the fest in the name of star performance which was not yet fixed. Final result was, we were able to attract a sponsorship of 7 lacs, somethings which was never done before. \nBy working in different teams, I\'ve learnt that the best ways to solve the problem of fellow members not performing is - First, make a well defined strategy and set target deliverables, second, always include them in every decision you take so that they feel included and third, take regular feedback of each other.

But one needs to be flexible and open-minded regarding implementation and must have the ability to take spontaneous impromptu decisions. I have been the Head Girl of my school during my 12th grade and I know that handling a group can be difficult at times. But right guidance and motivation can go a long way. Team members need something to root for, they need the assurance that their efforts, no matter what, will not go wasted and it is the responsibility of a team leader to provide them with exactly that kind of support.

Share a story about “seeing the light at the end of the tunnel” that you experienced personally.  This will help develop more rapport and enable trust from the “non-productive team member.”  Positive reinforcement includes primary reinforcers such as smiles, touch (hand shakes), verbal thanks and exchangeable reinforcement such as talk about payday, bonuses or potential promotions for achieving or exceeding goals.

The major responsibility I had was the execution of mechanical works of a power plant.The most important aspect of getting success at a construction project is teamwork. This is because it requires various types of people with diverse skillsets. All of them if works together can successfully complete the project. Even in my current institute I have been chosen as a member of the International Relations Committee. Also our curriculum is such that we have to work in teams to go through this course.\r\nWhen a fellow group member underperforms, I try to find out the reason for the same. It may be the work he/she is given or the motivation he/she is getting. So one way is to reshuffle the work between members. This gives them new energy.

Since, I had worked in the sponsorship team during my 3rd year too, I had complete info about the whole process and knew what could be the areas where we were lacking. So, first thing I did after taking the command was to first device a strategy by asking suggestions from everyone in the team. We came to the conclusion that – we were not completely tapping our local market, had a major problem in proposal, and poor promotion. Therefore, in response, we organized a complete separate event “Jalandhar got talent” for Jalandhar to attract local sponsors, stopped mentioning price brackets in the proposal, instead mentioned different prices for different companies, and at last played a gamble to sell the fest in the name of star performance which was not yet fixed. Final result was, we were able to attract a sponsorship of 7 lacs, somethings which was never done before. \r\nBy working in different teams, I\'ve learnt that the best ways to solve the problem of fellow members not performing is - First, make a well defined strategy and set target deliverables, second, always include them in every decision you take so that they feel included and third, take regular feedback of each other.',10,'sharma.himanshu','camp9417191631',1),('DMP3-387','DMP3-082','DMP3-319','Subhashish','Manna',8826281518,8826281518,'sm1539732@gmail.com','mannasubhashish@gmail.com','Delhi','Delhi',' Member','ECE , 3 year','Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, Delhi','Reduce the workload of fellow member.',8,'manna.subhashish','camp8826281518',1),('DMP3-387','DMP3-173','DMP3-320','Arnab','Banerjee',9874797736,9874797736,'arnab.banerjee2707@gmail.com','jonty.dude2707@gmail.com','Kolkata','West Bengal',' Member','PGDM + PGPM (2016-2018)','Unitedworld School of Business, Kolkata','I would motivate them to work for the team.',10,'banerjee.arnab','camp9874797736',1),('DMP3-387','DMP3-173','DMP3-321','Rishi','Raj Kohli',9999429972,9999429972,'rishirajkohli2011@gmail.com','rishirajkohli2011@gmail.com','Pitampura','Delhi',' Member','B.Com(H)-3 yr','Delhi School of Professional Studies and Research','Motivating them to perform',7,'rajkohli.rishi','camp9999429972',1),('DMP3-387','DMP3-173','DMP3-322','Divya','Verma',9643467609,9643467609,'vemadivya260@gmail.com','vemadivya260@gmail.com','Faridabad ','Haryana',' Member','BCom second year','Kamala Nehru College, Delhi University','I always find a way to complete the challenge in a best possible manner.
